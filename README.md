# WordCloud

**What is a Word Cloud?**

Pictorial representation of the most frequently occuring words in a file or book or even on Twitter for a particular Hashtag.

A word cloud can help a user understand which word appears more frequently. 
The larger the font size of the word more frequent that word is mentioned in the source.


With the help of a word cloud, we can engage our audience and also provide them with insight quickly. The user does not have to look at boring word counts or their frequencies in a tabular or bar chart format. This way large amount of data can be understood very quickly.

Below: 
- I am reading from a text file saved on GitHub. 
- Clean and process the read file. 
- Perform a word count.
- Display the WordCloud.

## Applications

- We can quickly get an idea of the most frequently used words in a novel and decide if we want to proceed with reading the book or not.
- We can collect data from Social Media using Hashtags(#) and then perform word cloud on it. We can learn what are people talking about with respect tothe Hashtag.

  - Hashtag can be a movie review or even a political campaign.

# Lessons Learnt:

 -  Learn the most frequent words.
 -  Opening and Reading a file saved on GitHub is a little different than reading a file from disk hard drive.
 -  Remove punctuations.
 -  For Loop.
